# Terraform Project for AWS Infrastructure

This project uses Terraform to automate the creation and management of AWS infrastructure. It defines resources like VPCs, subnets, security groups, and EC2 instances using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles.

## Features

- Automates the creation of a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with public and private subnets.
- Launches EC2 instances in the private subnets.
- Configures security groups for secure communication.
- Uses Terraform modules for reusable and scalable infrastructure code.
- Provides output of key infrastructure details like EC2 instance IDs, public IP addresses, and VPC IDs.

- **main.tf**: The main Terraform configuration file.
- **variables.tf**: Defines input variables used throughout the configuration.
- **outputs.tf**: Defines the outputs from the Terraform run, such as instance IDs.
- **terraform.tfvars**: Stores the values for the input variables.
- **modules/**: Contains reusable Terraform modules, such as for creating the VPC.

## Requirements

1. **Terraform**: Installed on your local machine. You can install Terraform by following the instructions [here](https://www.terraform.io/downloads).
2. **AWS Account**: Ensure you have an AWS account with appropriate IAM permissions to create resources.
3. **AWS CLI**: Configured with your AWS credentials. You can install and configure AWS CLI from [here](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/).

## Setup and Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Ebrahimabdelmonem1/Terraform.git
    cd Terraform
    ```

2. Initialize the Terraform project:
    ```bash
    terraform init
    ```

3. Plan the infrastructure:
    ```bash
    terraform plan
    ```

4. Apply the changes to provision the infrastructure:
    ```bash
    terraform apply
    ```

5. Review the outputs, such as EC2 instance IDs and public IP addresses, once Terraform finishes.

## Example Infrastructure

- **VPC**: Creates a custom VPC with public and private subnets spread across multiple Availability Zones.
- **EC2 Instances**: Launches EC2 instances in the private subnets, secured by appropriate security groups.
- **Security Groups**: Configures security rules to allow necessary traffic, such as SSH or HTTP.

## Clean-Up

To destroy all resources created by Terraform and avoid incurring costs, run:
```bash
terraform destroy
```
